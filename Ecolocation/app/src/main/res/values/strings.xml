    <string name="about_background">A plentiful supply of nutrients is vital for life to flourish on
        land and in the ocean. It is now recognised that animals disperse many of these nutrients
        across their landscapes, simply by eating and moving. Large animals in particular are
        important to this process as they often travel great distances, bringing essential minerals
        such as nitrogen and phosphorous to distant habitats as they pass through. \n

        Until recently Earth was home to an abundance of large animals. In this app, you can
        discover more about these fascinating creatures and learn about the vital role they played
        in keeping their environments fertile and healthy. Choose any location across the world’s
        continents to find a list of all living and extinct mammals and explore how their presence
        or absence impacts total animal nutrient distribution using interactive graphs. You can also
        create your own “what if” scenarios to forecast how nutrient distribution may change in the
        future.
